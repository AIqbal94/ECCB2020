# Introduction to web tools for protein structure classification
_____
The Protein Data Bank (PDB, pdb.org) is the unique repository of atomic coordinate files and other information about nucleic acids, proteins and complexes. Each coordinate file consists of a list of atoms in each structure and their 3D location in space.
 
The PDB is managed jointly by the World- wide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) consortium and is conformed by many members all around the world, in-cluding the US Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank ([RCSB PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/)), the Protein Data Bank in Europe ([PDBe](pdbe.org)), Protein Data Bank Japan ([PDBj](pdbj.org)) and BioMagResBank ([BMRB](www.bmrb.wisc.edu))

## Exercise 1

Let´s search an structure in the PDB and explore the database
1. Go to the ([PDBe](pdbe.org)) site and in the "search" upper-right green icon, write "Hemerythrin". 
2. Direct to the "Macromolecules" section in the upper-left side and click on the "Organism superkingdom"; select "Archaea".
3. Click on the structure [3cax][(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/3cax)

Go to the PDB database
Search their UniProt code
Direct to the SIFTS site and download the file “    “. Search all available lines that contain the UniProt code that correspond to our protein. This will give us all the available structures.
To identify if our sequence present disordered regions, we need to
