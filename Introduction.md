# Introduction to web tools for protein structure classification
_____
The Protein Data Bank (PDB, pdb.org) is the unique repository of atomic coordinate files and other information about nucleic acids, proteins and complexes. Each coordinate file consists of a list of atoms in each structure and their 3D location in space.
 
The PDB is managed jointly by the World- wide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) consortium and is conformed by many members all around the world, in-cluding the US Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB; rcsb.org), the Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe; pdbe.org), Protein Data Bank Japan (PDBj; pdbj.org) and BioMagResBank (BMRB; www.bmrb.wisc.edu).
