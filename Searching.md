## Searching for homologous protein structures
- By annotation (information-driven search approach): 
  - RCSB PDB 
  - [CATH](https://www.cathdb.info/)
  - [SCOPe](https://scop.berkeley.edu/)
  - [ECOD](http://prodata.swmed.edu/ecod/)
- By sequence similarity: 
  - RCSB PDB
  - [HHpred](https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/hhpred)
- By structure similarity: 
  - PDBeFold 
  - PDB search
