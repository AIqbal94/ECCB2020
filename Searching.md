# Searching for homologous protein structures
_____
There are two approaches to retrieve protein structural data: by annotation; or by similarity.  
The choice of strategy will depend on the type of information you have at the beginning of 
your search, as well as on the problem you are trying to solve.

## Exercise 1

1. Go to [PDBe](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/) and type "hemerythrin" in the search bar.

### By annotation (information-driven search approach) 
#### The Protein Data Bank database
[RCSB_PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/); [PDBe](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/); [PDBj](https://pdbj.org/)
#### Structure classification databases
- [CATH](https://www.cathdb.info/); 
- [SCOPe](https://scop.berkeley.edu/); 
- [ECOD](http://prodata.swmed.edu/ecod/)

### By sequence similarity: 
  - [RCSB PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/) 
  - [HHpred](https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/hhpred)
- By structure similarity: 
  - [PDBeFold](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/ssm/) 
  - [DALI - PDB search](http://ekhidna2.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali/)
