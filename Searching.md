## Searching for homologous protein structures

### Basic concepts
**Analogy vs. Homology** 
Orthology is the phylogenetic relationship where sequence divergence follows speciation. Fitch (2000) Trends in Genetics 16(5)

Paralogs originate by gene duplication. Jensen (2001) Genome Biol 2(8)

Multiple homologs in the same genome will always be paralogous.

Divergence via gene duplication precedes speciation.


There are two approaches to retrieve protein structural data: by annotation; or by similarity.\
The choice of strategy will depend on the type of information you have at the beginning of 
your search, as well as on the problem you are trying to solve.

- By annotation (information-driven search approach): 
  - [RCSB PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/) 
  - [CATH](https://www.cathdb.info/)
  - [SCOPe](https://scop.berkeley.edu/)
  - [ECOD](http://prodata.swmed.edu/ecod/)
- By sequence similarity: 
  - [RCSB PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/) 
  - [HHpred](https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/hhpred)
- By structure similarity: 
  - [PDBeFold](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/ssm/) 
  - [DALI - PDB search](http://ekhidna2.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali/)
