# Correspondences between protein sequence and structure
_____
In the 1960s, Christian Anfinsen postulated that the unique three-dimensional structure of a protein is determined by its amino acid sequence (sequence–structure–function paradigm). However, intrinsically disordered regions does not conform to this postulate. Disordered regions contribute to protein function and do not fold into a defined tertiary structure.

Protein structure prediction techniques fall into two main categories: Template-free (or de novo) and Template-based (or homology-modeling). The first one do not use any known structures. Useful when not a single structure in a protein family is known. Whereas the Template-based employ the similarity to another protein whose three-dimensional structure is known.
